# Assistive Gym v1.0 Extension

#### Federico Pivotto - UniPD BSc Thesis
***

## Thesis experimental activity

The experimental activity completed involved studying the operation of the Assistive Gym v1.0 framework and developing an extension to it. This includes support for the TIAGo robot, its integration into pre-existing simulation environments, and the creation of a new one in which the TIAGo robot is engaged in handovering an object to the human in a static or active condition.

This extension was subsequently used as an aid in the discussion conducted in the thesis, in which the importance of human-robot collaboration was highlighted, particularly in the industrial environment, and then experimented with the TIAGo robot on the usefulness of the contribution made by the human in training control policies and its impact in achieving the successful condition in some specific tasks. At the end, the results obtained were compared with those obtained by the authors of the framework with existing robots.

Control policies were generated for the pre-existing simulation environments and the new environment for the TIAGo robot over 1,000,000 timesteps. Computational limitations did not allow them to be refined further: in the future it might be useful to resume training and achieve the same level of learning as the authors' control policies, i.e., 10,000,000 timesteps.

## Extension contributions

### Support for TIAGo robot
The mesh model of the TIAGo robot was generated using the official packages made available by PAL Robotics in [GitHub](https://github.com/pal-robotics). From these, a customized one-armed TIAGo robot equipped with the PAL Parallel Gripper was extracted.

### TIAGo robot in pre-existing environments
The TIAGo robot was integrated within the pre-existing simulation environments in the framework: Itch Scratching, Bed Bathing, Drinking Water, Feeding, Dressing, and Arm Manipulation.

### Object Handover environment for TIAGo robot
The new simulation environment concerns the handovering of an object, specifically a [wrench](https://free3d.com/3d-model/combination-wrench-v1--661572.html), from the robot's end effector to the human's right hand and then restoring the former to its starting position. The TIAGo robot has been integrated into this environment, but simple modifications also allow the integration of robots already in the framework.

### Trained policies
For each pre-existing and new simulation environment, a control policy was generated for the TIAGo robot in both the static human case and the active human case. In total, there are 14 control policies, each learned over 1,000,000 timesteps.

The path followed during the experimental activity first led to the generation of the control policies with static human by employing the `ray[rllib]==1.12.1` module, and only later by employing the `ray[rllib]==1.3.0` module. In contrast, the control policies with active human were generated by directly adopting the `ray[rllib]==1.3.0` module due to framework malfunctions with `ray[rllib]==1.12.1` in this variant of the simulation environments.

All these control policies are made available within respective ZIP files, included within the `trained_models/ppo` directory:
```
pretrained_policies_tiago_statichuman_ray_1.12.1.zip
pretrained_policies_tiago_statichuman_ray_1.3.0.zip
pretrained_policies_tiago_activehuman_ray_1.3.0.zip
```

## Setup requirements

The installation of the framework was based on a virtual environment with Python 3.6.8 and the modules required by the Assistive Gym v1.0 setup. However, constraint and version upgrading of some modules and dependencies was necessary to succeed in the installation and full operation of the framework. Specifically, the modules subject to this change and the version fixed are:
```python
gym==0.15.7, tensorflow==2.6.2, keras==2.6.0, h5py==3.1.0, ray[rllib]==1.3.0, lz4==3.1.3
```

### Fix for TensorFlow 2.6.2

The upgrade to TensorFlow 2.6.2 required a refactor to replace a deprecated function used in the framework. In particular, the file subject to change is `assistive_gym/envs/agents/human.py/human.py` where the following line of code:
```python
result = self.limits_model.predict_classes(np.array([[tz2, tx2, ty2, qe2]]))
```
must be replaced with the code snippet:
```python
predict_class = self.limits_model.predict(np.array([[tz2, tx2, ty2, qe2]])) 
result = np.argmax(predict_class, axis=1)
```

## Base Features
### Human and robot models 
Customizable female and male human models (default body sizes and weights matching 50th percentile humans).  
40 actuated human joints (head, torso, arms, waist, and legs)  
&nbsp;  
![Human models](images/human_models.gif "Human models")  
&nbsp;

&nbsp;  
![Robot models](images/robot_models.gif "Robot models")
### Realistic human joint limits
Building off of prior research, Assistive Gym provides a model for realistic pose-dependent human joint limits.  
&nbsp;  
![Realistic human joint limits](images/realistic_human_joint_limits.gif "Realistic human joint limits")
### Robot base pose optimization
A robot's base pose can greatly impact the robot’s ability to physically assist people.  
We provide a baseline method using joint-limit-weighted kinematic isotopy (JLWKI) to select good base poses near a person.  
With JLWKI, the robot chooses base poses (position and yaw orientation) with high manipulability near end effector goals.  
&nbsp;  
![Robot base pose optimization](images/robot_base_pose_optimization.gif "Robot base pose optimization")
### Human preferences
During assistance, a person will typically prefer for the robot not to spill water on them, or apply large forces to their body.  
Assistive Gym provides a baseline set of human preferences unified across all tasks, which are incorporated directly into the reward function.
This allows robots to learn to provide assistance that is consist with a person's preferences.
